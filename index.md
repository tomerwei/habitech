**Professor Ruth Conroy Dalton**
Ruth is Lancaster University’s Inaugural Professor of Architecture. Her research interests are centred on the relationship between the spatial layout of buildings and environments and their effect on how people understand and interact in those spaces. She is an expert in space syntax analysis and using virtual environments as a method for researching human factors in the built environment.

**Professor Christoph Hölscher**
Christoph has been Professor of Cognitive Science at ETH Zurich since 2013. Currently a member of the Singapore-ETH Future Cities Laboratory, he is also the programme director of the Future Resilient Systems programme - the second programme at the centre. His areas of research include wayfinding, spatial cognition & usability research for architectural design, HCI, user modelling & personalisation, information retrieval & web search behaviour.

**Dr Jakub Krukar**

Jakub is a researcher and lecturer in spatial cognition - a branch of cognitive science studying how people think about, think in, and think with space. He is a psychologist by training, and he applies psychological methods in the fields of geoinformatics, architecture, and human-computer interaction. [(website)](https://krukar.staff.ifgi.de/)


**Assoc. Professor Nick Dalton**
Nick’s research exists in the crossover between architecture and human computer interaction. This includes areas such as space syntax in theoretical architecture. His current research area is that of very large-scale user interfaces: any user interface which is larger than a person. For example, this includes public
displays, a digital wine shop, information sculptures, table-sized multitouch group interactions etc. He is a founding member of NORSC (Northumbria’s social computing research group).

**UNStudio Architects**
UNStudio, founded in 1988 by Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, is an international architectural design network with four full-service international offices in Amsterdam, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Frankfurt. They specialise in architecture, interior architecture, product design, urban development and infrastructural projects.

**Professor Mikael Wiberg**
Mikael is a Professor of Informatics at Umeå university, Sweden. He is editor for the Architecture & Interaction forum for ACM Interactions, and his research interests includes a focus on interaction design at the scale of architecture, an interest in the materiality of interaction, and an interest in concept-driven design methods. He is the author of a recent book, "The Materiality of Interaction - Notes on the Materials of Interaction Design" (MIT Press, Jan 2018).
